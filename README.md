My MIDI, Music, Media, Movie Console, Controller, Commander

I originally started to make this program to have something that could control my MIDI piano via a raspberrypi.  First, it had to constantly be listening for someone to play and record that playing.  Second, it needed to play a directory of MIDI songs with one button.  Finally, since it will sit on the piano, Since, mine uses a screen, it should default to playing a slide show while it is listening for someone to play the piano...
